# ZhuaTech DeviceHub

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for connected devices, edge operations, and multi-screen experiences.

ZhuaTech DeviceHub provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for connected devices, edge operations, and multi-screen experiences. It is designed for device operators, field teams, service managers, and platform administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise devicehub, self-hosted devicehub, self-hosted enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Enterprise Use

- **Primary users:** Device operators, field teams, service managers, and platform administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Core Capabilities

- **Remote status and command workflows** — Coordinate remote status and command workflows through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Content, policy, or task distribution** — Track content, policy, or task distribution metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Offline and retry-aware operations** — Preserve offline and retry-aware operations evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Alerts, telemetry, and dashboards** — Expose alerts, telemetry, and dashboards in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Tenant, role, and device audit controls** — Connect tenant, role, and device audit controls to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.
